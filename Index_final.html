    <img src="images/DSC03306-scaled.jpg" alt="One of my photography favorites" width="600" height="400"/>
    <p id = 'main'>Above, my photography website is linked, as well with one of my favorite pictures I have taken, click the image to see another one!
        I also will include an image of myself below :0
    
        In the future I plan on adding a few more elements to my personal website, primarily:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding More images</li>
        <li>Getting a better headshot of myself</li>
        <li>Getting better at my HTML skills!</li>
    </ul>
